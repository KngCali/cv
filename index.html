          My name is Cory O'neil Callis and I am 30 years old with a degree in history that i am doing nothing with. I am currently working at a Job that I am so thankful for, but its not the job i would want to do forever. I had a moment last week
          at work
          where i said this cant be life and I should be doing someting that is paying more than $20 dollars and hour. Thats when the lord spoke to me and said confirmed that IT was the field that i needed to be in.
